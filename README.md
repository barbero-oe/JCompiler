This project is based on abandoned code by [@trung](https://github.com/trung/InMemoryJavaCompiler).

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple API for in-memory compilation of Java code. While the JDK provides a full-blown API for this, in many cases a much simpler API is sufficient.

Compiling Java classes is as simple as this:

```java
// TBD add the code
```

**Note**: Please make sure you use JDK in your runtime
